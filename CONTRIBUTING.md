## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

*   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ArtaphyLabs/SoarZip/issues).
*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ArtaphyLabs/SoarZip/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

*   Open a new issue to start a discussion about your idea. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement, why it's needed, and potential implementation details.
*   This allows the community to provide feedback before significant effort is put into development.
